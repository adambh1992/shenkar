           80' "Showtime"

        <p>
            The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed "Showtime" due to their fast break-offense led by Magic Johnson.<br>
            The team won five championships in a nine-year span.<br>
            "Showtime" contained to Hall of Famers Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy, and was led by Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley.

            90' to now
        </h2>
        <p>
            The team struggled in the early 1990s, before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996.<br>
            With the duo, who were led by another Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, the team won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002, securing the franchise its second "three-peat".<br>
            The Lakers won two more championships in 2009 and 2010, but failed to regain their former glory in the following decade.
